[0.9.13]
* Fixed some timer functions

[0.9.12]
* Fixed a bug with log level printing. Now errors are printed.
* Added setPoint, heatingMode, lux, WhTotal, WhToday, WActual attributes to devices that support it. No need to access rawData for these anymore.

[0.9.11]
* Added log method to domoticz object. Using this to log message in the Domoticz log will respect the log level setting in the settings file. [dannybloe]
* Updated readme. Better overview, more attributes described.
* Added iterator functions (forEach and filter) to domoticz.devices, domoticz.changedDevices and domoticz.variables to iterate or filter more easily over these collections.
* Added a couple of example scripts.

[0.9.10]
* A little less verbose debug logging. Domoticz seems not to print all message in the log. If there are too many they may get lost. [dannybloe]
* Added method fetchHttpDomoticzData to domoticz object so you can manually trigger getting device information from Domoticz through http. [dannybloe]
* Added support for sounds in domiticz.notify(). [WebStarVenlo]

[0.9.9]
* Fixed a bug where every trigger name was treated as a wild-carded name. Oopsidayzy...

[0.9.8]
* Fixed a bug where a device can have underscores in its name.
* Added dimTo(percentage) method to control dimmers.
* Modified the switch-like commands to allow for timing options: .for_min(), .within_min(), after_sec() and after_min() methods to control delays and durations. Removed the options argument to the switch functions. See readme.
* Added switchSelector method on a device to set a selector switch.
* Added wild-card option for triggers
* Added http request data from Domoticz to devices. Now you can check the battery level and switch type and more. Make sure to edit dzVents_settings.lua file first and check the readme for install instructions!!!
* Added log level setting in dzVents_settings.lua

[0.9.7]
Added domoticz object resource structure. Updated readme accordingly. No more (or hardly any) need for juggling with all the Domoticz Lua tables and commandArrays.
