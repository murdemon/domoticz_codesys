About
=============
 
dzVents (|diː ziː vɛnts| short for Domotiz Easy Events) brings Lua scripting in Domoticz to whole new level. Writing scripts for Domoticz has never been so easy. Not only can you define triggers more easily, and have full control over timer-based scripts with extensive scheduling support, dzVents presents you with an easy to use API to all necessary information in Domoticz. No longer do you have to combine all kinds of information given to you by Domoticzs in many different data tables. You don't have to construct complex commandArrays anymore. dzVents encapsulates all the Domoticz peculiarities regarding controlling and querying your devices. And on top of that, script performance has increased a lot if you have many scripts because Domoticz will fetch all device information only once for all your device scripts and timer scripts.
 
Let's start with an example. Let's say you have a switch that when activated, it should activate another switch but only if the room temperature is above a certain level. And when done, it should send a notification. This is how it looks like in dzVents:

```
return {
	active = true,
	on = {
		'Room switch'
	},

	execute = function(domoticz, roomSwitch)
		
		if (roomSwitch.state == 'On' and domoticz.devices['Living room'].temperature > 18) then
			domoticz.devices['Another switch'].switchOn()
			domoticz.notify('This rocks!', 
			                'Turns out that it is getting warm here', 
			                domoticz.PRIORITY_LOW)
		end
					
	end
}

```
Or you have a timer script that should be executed every 10 minutes but only on weekdays and have it do something with some user variables and only during daytime:

```
return {
	active = true, 
	on = {
		['timer'] = {'Every 10 minutes on mon,tue,wed,thu,fri'}
	},

	execute = function(domoticz)
		
		-- check time of the day
		if (domoticz.time.isDayTime and domoticz.variables['myVar'].nValue == 10) then
			domoticz.variables['anotherVar'].set(15)
			--activate my scene
			domoticz.setScene('Evening lights', 'On')
			if (domoticz.devices['My PIR'].lastUpdate.minutesAgo > 5) then
                domoticz.devices['Bathroom lights'].switchOff()
            end
		end			
					
	end
}
```

Just to give you an idea! Everything that was previously scattered around in a dozen Lua tables is now logically available in the domoticz object structure. From there you can get to all the information and you can control the devices.

Installing
=============
*First of all, installing dzVents will not affect any of the scripts you have already in place so you can try dzVents without disrupting things.*

Note: this code is *not* tested on a non-linux machine like Windows. I'm almost certain you will have complications. 

Download the latest release from [GitHub](https://github.com/dannybloe/dzVents/releases), unzip it. 
Form the extracted zip folder copy the following to the Domoticz script folder (`/path/to/domoticz/scripts/lua`):

 -  The `dzVents` folder. This folder contains all the dzVents logic
 - `script_time_main.lua`
 - `script_device_main.lua`
 - `dzVents_settings.lua` and 
 - the folder `scripts` 

After doing so you will have this structure:
```
domoticz/
	scripts/
		lua/
			dzVents/
				... <dzVents files> ...
				examples/ 
				tests/
			scripts/
			script_time_main.lua
			script_device_main.lua
			dzVents_settings.lua
			... <other stuff that was already there> ...
```

Edit the file `dzVents_settings.lua` and enter the ip number and port number of your Domoticz instance. Make sure that you don't need a username/password for local networks (see Domoticz settings) or dzVents will not be able to fetch additional data like battery status and device type information! If you don't want  or need this then you can set `['Enable http fetch']` to `false`.

The scripts folder is where you put your new Lua event scripts. You can give them any name with the `.lua` extension (no need for *script_device* nor *script_time* prefixing).

Quickstart
-------------
After you placed the dzVents files in the right location we can do a quick test if everything works:

 - Pick a switch in your Domoticz system. Note down the exact name of the switch. If you don't have a switch then you can create a Dummy switch and use that one.
 - Create a new script in the `scripts/` folder. Call it `test.lua`.
 - Open `test.lua` in an editor and fill it with this code and change `<exact name of the switch>` with the .. you guessed it... exact name of the switch device:
 
```
return {
	active = true,
	on = {
		'<exact name of the switch>'
	},
	execute = function(domoticz, switch)
		if (switch.state == 'On') then
			domoticz.notify('Hey!', 'I am on!',
			domoticz.PRIORITY_NORMAL)
		else
			domoticz.notify('Hey!', 'I am off!',
			domoticz.PRIORITY_NORMAL)
		end
	end
}
```
 - Save the script
 - Open the Domoticz log in the browser
 - In Domoticz (another tab perhaps) press the switch. 
 - You can watch the log in Domoticz and it should show you that indeed it triggered your script.
 - Assuming of course that you have configured the notify options in Domoticz. Otherwise you can change the lines with `domoticz.notify` to `domoticz.email(<your address>)`.

The [examples folder](/dzVents/examples) has a couple of example scripts

How does it to work?
============
Normally, every time a device is updated in Domoticz it scans the script folder `../domoticz/scripts/lua` and executes *every script it can find starting with script_device* but before it does so, for each and every script, it builds all the necessary global Lua tables. This takes quite some time especially when you have a lot of scripts. Also, you have to program logic in every script to prevent the code from being executed when you don't want to (e.g. the device wasn't updated).
 
dzVents optimizes this process. All the event scripts that you make using dzVents will have to sit in the scripts folder and the two main script `script_device_main.lua` and `script_time.main.lua` make sure the right event scripts are called. Don't change these two files. 

All other scripts can live alongside the dzVents scripts. However, in order to have them work with dzVents you have to adapt them a little (and move them over to the scripts folder).

*Note: there are two other kinds of scripts that Domoticz might call: `script_security..` and `script_variable..`. They will not be affected by dzVents just yet.*

So, how to adapt the scripts?

Adapting or creating your scripts
----------------------------------
In order for your scripts to work with dzVents, they have to be turned into a Lua module. Basically you make sure it returns a Lua table (object) with a couple of predefined keys `active`, `on` and `execute`.. Here is an example:

```
return {
    active = true,
    on = {
        'My switch'
    },
    
    execute = function(domoticz, device)
        -- your script logic goes here, something like this:
        
        if (device.state == 'On') then
            domoticz.notify('I am on!', '', domoticz.PRIORITY_LOW)
        end
        
    end
}
```
Simply said, if you want to turn your existing script into a script that can be used with dzVents, you put it inside the execute function.

So, the module returns a table with these sections (keys):

* **on**: (*don't confuse this with **on**/off, it is more like: **on** < some event > **execute** < code >*). This is a table (or array) with **one or more** trigger events:
    * The name of your device between string quotes. **You can use the asterisk (\*) wild-card here e.g. `PIR_*` or `*_PIR` .** Note that in one cycle several devices could have been updated. If you have a script with a wild-card trigger that matches all the names of these changed devices, then this script will be executed *for all these changed devices*.  
    * The index of your device (the name may change, the index will usually stay the same), 
    * The string or table 'timer' which makes the script execute every minute (see the section **timer trigger options** [below](#timer-trigger-options)). 
    * Or a **combination**.
     
    So you can put as many triggers in there as you like and only if one of those is met, then the **execute** part is executed by dzVents.
* **active**: this can either be:
	* a boolean value (`true` or `false`, no quotes!). When set to `false`, the script will not be called. This is handy for when you are still writing the script and you don't want it to be executed just yet or when you simply want to disable it. 
	* A function returning `true` or `false`. The function will receive the domoticz object with all the information about you domoticz instance: `active = function(domoticz) .... end`. So for example you could check for a Domoticz variable or switch and prevent the script from being executed. **However, be aware that for *every script* in your scripts folder, this active function will be called, every cycle!! So, it is better to put all your logic in the execute function instead of in the active function.** Maybe it is better to not allow a function here at all... /me wonders.
* **execute**: This is the actual logic of your script. You can copy the code from your existing script into this section. What is special is that dzVents will pass the [domoticz object](#domoticz-object-api) and, for device triggers, the actual [device](#device-object-api) causing the script to be called. These two objects are all you need to access almost everything in your Domoticz system including all methods to manipulate them like modifying switches or sending notifications. *There shouldn't be any need to manipulate the commandArray anymore.* (If there is a need, please let me know and I'll fix it). More about the domoticz object below.

**Note**: if you have a script with *both a device trigger and a timer trigger* then only in the case of when a device update occurs, the changed device is passed into the execute function. When the timer triggers the script then this second parameter is `nil`. You will have to check for this situation in you script. 

*timer* trigger options
-------------
There are several options for time triggers. It is important to know that Domoticz timer events are only trigger once every minute. So that is the smallest interval for you timer scripts. However, dzVents gives you a great many options to have full control over when and how often your timer scripts are called (all times are in 24hr format!). You can create full schedules (sorry about the weird bracket syntax, that's just Lua):

```
on = {
    'timer'                            -- the simplest form, causes the script to be called every minute
    ['timer'] = 'every minute',        -- same as above: every minute
    ['timer'] = 'every other minute',  -- minutes: xx:00, xx:02, xx:04, ..., xx:58
    ['timer'] = 'every <xx> minutes',  -- starting from xx:00 triggers every xx minutes
                                       -- (0 > xx < 60)
    ['timer'] = 'every hour',          -- 00:00, 01:00, ..., 23:00  (24x per 24hrs)
    ['timer'] = 'every other hour',    -- 00:00, 02:00, ..., 22:00  (12x per 24hrs)
    ['timer'] = 'every <xx> hours',    -- starting from 00:00, triggers every xx 
                                       -- hours (0 > xx < 24)
    ['timer'] = 'at 13:45',            -- specific time
    ['timer'] = 'at *:45',             -- every 45th minute in the hour
    ['timer'] = 'at 15:*',             -- every minute between 15:00 and 16:00
    ['timer'] = 'at 13:45 on mon,tue', -- at 13:45 only on Monday en Tuesday (english)
    ['timer'] = 'every hour on sat',   -- you guessed it correctly
    ['timer'] = 'at sunset',           -- uses sunset/sunrise info from Domoticz
    ['timer'] = 'at sunrise',
    ['timer'] = 'at sunset on sat,sun'
    
    -- and last but not least, you can create a table with multiples:
    ['timer'] = {'at 13:45', 'at 18:37', 'every 3 minutes'},

},
```
**One important note: if Domoticz, for whatever reason, skips a beat (skips a timer event) then you may miss the trigger! So you may have to build in some fail-safe checks or some redundancy if you have critical time-based stuff to control. There is nothing dzVents can do about it**

The domoticz object
===================
And now the most interesting part. Before, all the device information was scattered around in a dozen global Lua tables like `otherdevices` or `devicechanged`. You had to write a lot of code to collect all this information and build your logic around it. And, when you want to update switches and stuff you had to fill the commandArray with often low-level stuff in order to make it work.

**IMPORTANT: Make sure that all your devices have unique names!! dzVents doesn't check for duplicates!!**

Fear no more: introducing the **domoticz resource object**.

The domoticz object contains everything that you need to know in your scripts and all the methods (hopefully) to manipulate your devices and sensors. Getting this information has never been more easy: 

`domoticz.time.isDayTime` or `domoticz.devices['My sensor'].temperature` or `domoticz.devices['My sensor'].lastUpdate.minutesAgo`.   

So this object structure contains all the information logically arranged where you would expect it to be. Also, it harbors methods to manipulate Domoticz or devices. dzVents will create the commandArray contents for you and all you have to do is something like `domoticz.devices[123].switchOn().for_min(5).after_sec(10)` or `domoticz.devices['My dummy sensor'].updateBarometer(1034, domoticz.BARO_THUNDERSTORM)`.

*The intention is that you don't have to construct low-level commandArray-commands for Domoticz anymore!* Please let me know if there is anything missing there. Of course there is a method `domotiz.sendCommand(..)` that allows you to send raw Domoticz commands in case there indeed is some update function missing.

Domoticz object API
-----------
The domoticz object holds all information about your Domoticz system. It has a couple of global attributes and methods to query and manipulate your system. It also has a collection of **devices** and **variables** (user variables in Domoticz) and when applicable, a collection of **changedDevices**. There three collection each have two iterator functions: `forEach(function)` and `filter(function)` to make searching for devices easier. See iterators below.

### Domoticz attributes:

 - **changedDevices**: *Table*. A collection holding all the devices that have been updated in this cycle.
 - **devices**: *Table*. A collection with all the *device objects*. You can get a device by its name or id: `domoticz.devices[123]` or `domoticz.devices['My switch']`. See **Device object** below. 
 - **security**: Holds the state of the security system e.g. `Armed Home` or `Armed Away`.
 - **time**:
	 - **isDayTime**
	 - **isNightTime**
	 - **sunsetInMinutes**
	 - **sunriseInMinutes**
 - **variables**: *Table*. A collection holding all the user *variable objects* as defined in Domoticz. See **Variable object** for the attributes.  

### Domoticz methods

 - **email(subject, message, mailTo)**: *Function*. Send email.
 - **fetchHttpDomoticzData**: *Function*. This will trigger a script that will download the device data from Domoticz and stores this on the filesystem for dzVents to use. This data contains information like battery level and device type information that can only be fetched through an http call. Normally dzVents will do this automatically in the background if it is enabled in the `dzVents_settings.lua` file. If you want to do this manually through an event script perhaps (you can use a switch trigger for instance) then you can disable the automatic fetching by changing the setting in `dzVents_settings.lua` and create your own event.
 - **log(message, [level]):** *Function*. Creates a logging entry in the Domoticz log but respects the log level settings. You can provide the loglevel: `domoticz.LOG_INFO`, `domoticz.LOG_DEBUG` or `domoticz.LOG_ERROR`. In `dzVents_settings.lua` you can specify which kind of log message will be printed.
 - **notify(subject, message, priority, sound)**: *Function*. Send a notification (like Prowl). Priority can be like `domoticz.PRIORITY_LOW, PRIORITY_MODERATE, PRIORITY_NORMAL, PRIORITY_HIGH, PRIORITY_EMERGENCY`. For sound see the SOUND constants below.
 - **openURL(url)**: *Function*. Have Domoticz 'call' a URL.
 - **sendCommand(command, value)**: *Function*. Generic command method (adds it to the commandArray) to the list of commands that are being sent back to domoticz. *There is likely no need to use this directly. Use any of the device methods instead (see below).*
 - **setScene(scene, value)**: *Function*. E.g. `domoticz.setScene('My scene', 'On')`. Supports timing options. See below.
 - **sms(message)**: *Function*. Sends an sms if it is configured in Domoticz. 
 - **switchGroup(group, value)**: *Function*. E.g. `domoticz.switchGroup('My group', 'Off')`. Supports timing options. See below.

### Iterators
The domoticz object has three collections (tables): devices, changedDevices and variables. In order to make iterating over these collections easier dzVents has two iterator methods so you don't need to use the `pair()` or `ipairs()` function anymore (less code to write):

 1. **forEach(function):** Executes a provided function once per array element. The function receives the item in the collection (device or variable) and the key.
 2. **filter(function):** returns items in the collection for which the function returns true.

Best to illustrate with an example:

```
	domoticz.devices.forEach(function(device)
		if (device.batteryLevel < 20) then
			-- do something
		end
	end)
```
Or using a filter:
```
	local deadDevices = domoticz.devices.filter(function(device)
		return (device.lastUpdate.minutesAgo > 60)
	end)
	deadDevices.forEach(function(zombie)
		-- do something
	end)
```
Of course you can chain:
```
	domoticz.devices.filter(function(device)
		return (device.lastUpdate.minutesAgo > 60)
	end).forEach(function(zombie)
		-- do something with the zombie
	end)
```

### Contants

Device object API
------
Each device in Domoticz can be found in the `domoticz.devices` collection as listed above. The device object has a set of fixed attributes like *name* and *id*. Many devices though (like sensors) have special attributes like *temperature*, *humidity* etc. These attributes are also available on each device object *when applicable*. However, not all attributes are passed to dzVents by Domoticz as named attributes like temperature. In that case you can find the values in the rawData attribute:

```
	domoticz.devices['mySensor'].temperature
	domoticz.devices['myLightSensor'].rawData[1] -- lux value
```

### Device attributes

 - **batteryLevel**: *Number* (note this is the raw value from Domoticcz and can be 255)
 - **bState**: *Boolean*. Is true for some commong states like 'On' or 'Open' or 'Motion'. 
 - **barometer**: Only when applicable.
 - **changed**: *Boolean*. True if the device was changed
 - **deviceSubType**: *String*. See Domoticz devices table in Domoticz GUI.
 - **deviceType**: *String*. See Domoticz devices table in Domoticz GUI.
 - **dewpoint**: Only when applicable.

 - **humidity**: Only when applicable.
 - **id**: *Number*. Id of the device
 - **lastUpdate**: 
	 - **day**: *Number*
	 - **hour**: *Number*
	 - **isToday**: *Boolean*. Indicates if the device was updated today
	 - **month**: *Number*
	 - **min**: *Number*
	 - **minutesAgo**: *Number*. Number of minutes since the last update.
	 - **raw**: *String*. Generated by Domoticz
	 - **sec**: *Number*
	 - **secondsAgo**: *Number*. Number of seconds since the last update.
	 - **year**: *Number*

 - **lux**: *Number*. Lux level for light sensors.
 - **name**: *String*. Name of the device
 - **rain**: Only when applicable.
 - **rainLastHour**: Only when applicable.
 - **rawData**: *Table*:  Not all information from a device is available as a named attribute on the device object. That is because Domoticz doesn't provide this as such. If you have a multi-sensor for instance then you can find all data points in this **rawData** *String*. It is an array (Lua table). E.g. to get the Lux value of a sensor you can do this: `local lux = mySensor.rawData[1]` (assuming it is the first value that is passed by Domoticz). Note that the values are string types!! So if you expect a number, convert it first (`tonumber(device.rawData[1]`).
 - **signalLevel**: *String*. See Domoticz devices table in Domoticz GUI.
 - **state**: *String*. For switches this holds the state like 'On' or 'Off'. For dimmers that are on, it is also 'On' but there is a level attribute holding the dimming level. **For selector switches** (Dummy switch) the state holds the *name* of the currently selected level. The corresponding numeric level of this state can be found in the **rawData** attribute: `device.rawData[1]`.
 - **setPoint**: *Number*. Holds the set point for thermostat like devices. 
 - **heatingMode**: *String*. For zoned thermostats like EvoHome.
 - **switchType**: *String*. See Domoticz devices table in Domoticz GUI.
 - **switchTypeValue**: *Number*. See Domoticz devices table in Domoticz GUI.
 - **temperature**: Only when applicable.
 - **utility**: Only when applicable.
 - **uv**: Only when applicable.

 - **updateVoltage(voltage)**: *Function*. 
 - **updateWind(bearing, direction, speed, gust, temperature, chill)**: *Function*. 

> "Hey!! I don't see my sensor readings in the device object!! Where is my LUX value for instance?"

That may be because Domoticz doesn't pass all the device data as named attributes. If you cannot find your attribute then you can inspect the **rawData** attribute of the device. This is a table (array) of values. So for a device that has a Lux value you may access it like this:

    local lux = mySensor.rawData[0]
Other devices may have more stuff in the rawData attribute like wind direction, energy info etc etc.

Variable object API
------
User variables created in Domoticz have these attributes and methods:

### Variable attributes

 - **nValue**: *Number*. **value** cast to number.
 - **value**: Raw value coming from Domoticz
 - **lastUpdate**: 
	 - **day**: *Number*
	 - **hour**: *Number*
	 - **isToday**: *Boolean*. Indicates if the device was updated today
	 - **min**: *Number*
	 - **minutesAgo**: *Number*. Number of minutes since the last update.
	 - **month**: *Number*
	 - **raw**: *String*. Generated by Domoticz
	 - **sec**: *Number*
	 - **year**: *Number*

### Variable methods

 - **set(value)**: *Function*. Tells Domoticz to update the variable. *No need to cast it to a string first (it will be done for you).*


Switch timing options (delay, duration)
---
To specify a duration or a delay for the various switch command you can do this:

    -- switch on for 2 minutes after 10 seconds
    device.switchOn().after_sec(10).for_min(2) 
    
    -- switch on for 2 minutes after a randomized delay of 1-10 minutes
    device.switchOff().within_min(10).for_min(2) 
    device.close().for_min(15)
    device.open().after_sec(20)
    device.open().after_min(2)

 - **after_sec(seconds)**: *Function*. Activates the command after a certain amount of seconds.
 - **after_min(minutes)**: *Function*. Activates the command after a certain amount of minutes.
 - **for_min(minutes)**: *Function*. Activates the command for the duration of a certain amount of minutes (cannot be specified in seconds).
 - **within_min(minutes)**: *Function*. Activates the command within a certain period *randomly*.

Note that **dimTo()** doesn't support **duration()**.

Final note
==
If you don't want to rewrite all your scripts at once you can have dzVents live along side your other scripts. They do not influence each other at all. You can move your scripts over one by one as you see fit to the scripts folder dzVents uses.

Oh, this code is tested on a linux file system. It should work on Windows. Let me know if it doesn't. There is some code in event_helpers.lua that is need to get a list of all the script in the scripts folder. 

Another note: I haven't tested all the various `device.update*` methods. Please let me know if I made any mistakes there or fix them yourselves and create a pull request (or email me) in GitHub.

Good luck and hopefully you enjoy using dzVents.
